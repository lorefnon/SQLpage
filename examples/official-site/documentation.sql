If you are completely new to SQLPage, you should start by reading the [get started tutorial](get%20started.sql),
which will guide you through the process of creating your first SQLPage application.

Building an application with SQLPage is quite simple.
To create a new web page, just create a new SQL file. 
For each SELECT statement that you write, the data it returns will be analyzed and rendered to the user.
The two most important concepts in SQLPage are **components** and **parameters**.

 - **components** are small user interface elements that you can use to display your data in a certain way.
 - *top-level* **parameters** are the properties of these components, allowing you to customize their appearance and behavior.
 - *row-level* **parameters** constitute the data that you want to display in the components.

To select a component and set its top-level properties, you write the following SQL statement: 

```sql
SELECT ''component_name'' AS component, ''my value'' AS top_level_parameter_1;
```

Then, you can set its row-level parameters by writing a second SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT my_column_1 AS row_level_parameter_1, my_column_2 AS row_level_parameter_2 FROM my_table;
```

This page documents all the components provided by default in SQLPage and their parameters.
Use this as a reference when building your SQL application.
If at any point you need help, you can ask for it on the [SQLPage forum](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/discussions).

If you know some [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics),
you can also easily [create your own components for your application](./custom_components.sql).
